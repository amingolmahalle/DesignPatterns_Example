# DesignPatterns_Example

<h3>Abstract Factory:</h3>
According to Gang of Four Definition: “The Abstract Factory Design Pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes“.

<h3>Facade:</h3>

Facade pattern hides the complexities of the system and provides an interface to the client using which the client can access the system.

The facade design pattern is particularly used when a system is very complex or difficult to understand because the system has a large number of interdependent classes or its source code is unavailable.

The Facade (usually a wrapper) sits on the top of a group of subsystems and allows them to communicate in a unified manner.

Use Facade Design When There are many dependencies between clients and the implementation classes.
